BEFORE PRINTING:
Line numbers and milestones and other numerations are displayed slightly too low.
Line numbers and milestones and other numerations are too big?

Something really bad happens in ΨΕΥΔΟΣΟΦΙΣΤΗΣ Η ΣΟΛΟΙΚΙΣΤΗΣ with margin notes

SECONDARY:
Font selection.
Replace chapters with parts
Cache downloaded files
Refactor TextNodeKind, formatting selection, generation in scaife etc. (so that it's not everywhere?).
